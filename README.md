# `operating_systems`

This is the source code our for operating systems project written back in (cough, cough) for my Marist College
operating systems course. if was written as a group project with my friend Dominic Bruen and a third person whom
I don't remember; I think that his first name was Rajar.

The original source code may be found in the `operating_systems_marist` folder. C++ was the lingua
franca of software development at the time that we were in grad school.

The purpose of this project is to recreate that project to clear the cobwebs of my operating systems knowledge but in Rust using the latest prefered practices.

My memory is that Dr. Sharma required us to do I/O as if it were an IBM System/390. I don't have the 
original requirements document. I don't remember if we had to support a given instruction set for the main processor or if we were free to create our own.

This is but one project to solidify my knowledge of Rust.
